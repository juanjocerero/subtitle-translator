1
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,437
[wind rushing]

2
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,794
[man] Good morning.

3
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,077
On this day, July 1st, 2014,

4
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,390
at this hour, 0600.

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,915
We are at the very first
airport in the world...

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,709
[woman] The topic of so much
controversy over the past seven years

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,036
has continued development.

8
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,839
Protests from environmental
groups and a number

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,913
of developing countries continue.
But in accordance with...

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,914
[man] It had been claimed that CW7
is the answer to global warming.

11
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,958
And we are witnessing it.

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,237
[woman] Leaders who argue that global
warming can no longer be ignored.

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,353
Today, 79 countries
will began dispersing CW7

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,909
into the upper layers
of the atmosphere.

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,392
[man] ...in the upper layers
of the atmosphere

16
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,597
and surprisingly bring down
the average global temperature

17
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,718
to the finest levels.
It is just a day away that...

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,030
[woman] ...upper layers
of the atmosphere.

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,512
According to scientists, the artificial
cooling substance, CW7,

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,310
will succeed in bringing average global
temperatures down to manageable levels,

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,076
as a revolutionary solution
to mankind's warming of the planet.

22
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,670
- Head check.
- OK.

23
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,231
All right, get in line.

24
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,509
Everybody sit down.

25
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,468
One, two, three,

26
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,030
four, five, six.

27
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,912
Keep going.

28
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,190
Go on.

29
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,509
Hey you, sit down.

30
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,672
Curtis, sit down.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,230
Sit down.

32
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,513
I said sit down!

33
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,475
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Counting.

34
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,797
Can't you sit and count?
Do you want to get shot? You're crazy.

35
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,757
Shut up, Edgar. I'm thinking.

36
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,713
Are there any experienced
violinists here?

37
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,757
Raise your hands.

38
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,549
- Violinist!
- Stand up, come forward.

39
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,312
[soldier] Food, come and get it.

40
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,436
Violinists? Are they're having a laugh?

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,876
Those bastards in the front
sections think they own us.

42
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,152
Eating their steak dinners and listening
to string quartets and that.

43
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,151
We'll be different when we get there.

44
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,357
[sighs] I want steak.

45
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,190
Excuse me, sir.
My wife and I played violin

46
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,510
in the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

47
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,159
I was first chair.

48
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,833
Can you still play?

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,513
Of course, you never forget.

50
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,398
Show me your hands.

51
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,555
Leave your belongings,
we just need your hands.

52
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,190
- Not both?
- Yes, both hands.

53
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,114
My wife, Doris, plays beautifully.
Better than me, even.

54
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,191
They just need one person.

55
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,396
Then I won't go.

56
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,117
[woman] Doris. Doris!

57
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,998
- [woman screams]
- No! [shouting]

58
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,752
- [bones snapping]
- [Doris screams]

59
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,592
[soldier] Sit down, everyone!

60
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,679
- Sit down.
- No, they can't just...

61
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,239
Sit down.

62
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,711
Those fucking bastards.

63
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,199
Now isn't the time.

64
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,078
Well, when is the time?

65
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,468
Soon.

66
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,792
Doris. I'll be back, Doris.
It's all right.

67
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,799
I'll come back.

68
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,236
What does steak taste like again?

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,391
I had it once, but I can't remember.

70
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,676
[Curtis] If you can't remember
then it's better to forget.

71
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,638
All right, then. What does it
smell like when it's cooking and that?

72
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,711
When it's emanating
around the place.

73
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,791
Curtis, is this it?

74
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,030
- It's not it.
- No.

75
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,589
- Hey, I heard that...
- [woman] Curtis, here!

76
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,235
Timbo.
How's it hanging, buddy?

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,070
Give me a pound.
Blow it up.

78
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,952
[makes explosion sound]

79
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,152
Hey, listen.
I think I need that protein block.

80
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,153
How about I trade you,
this one for that one?

81
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,469
Mmm...

82
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,589
No?

83
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,320
Nice bargaining powers, Curtis.
Here, give me this one,

84
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,152
- I'll give you that...
- Relax, relax.

85
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,912
Come here, Timmy.
Come here.

86
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,595
Come right... ooh... [grunts]

87
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,716
I have an idea.

88
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,355
I will give you this one
and that one for that one.

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,232
- What do you say?
- No.

90
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,637
- Go get him.
- [sighing]

91
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,519
Timmy!

92
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,716
Timothy, your mom is gonna give
you a damn good spanking.

93
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,438
I don't know where the fuck he went.

94
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,831
Hey, come here.
Give us it. Give us it.

95
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,712
All right, Jose,
how are you doing, man?

96
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,480
- [man] Get off!
- Timmy, off you go.

97
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,959
[indistinct chattering]

98
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,633
Edgar, why did you
let him get up there?

99
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,229
I didn't, He got up there by himself.
He's very nimble.

100
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,391
- He's five.
- He's a very nimble five year old.

101
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,028
[mother] Timmy, sweetie, come down.

102
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,119
Hey, come here.

103
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,350
What do you want for it?

104
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,788
In the whole wide train?

105
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,791
In the whole wide train.

106
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,473
The ball.

107
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,437
The ball? No.

108
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,273
No, I'm sorry I can't do that.
I can't do that.

109
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,238
Yes, I get the ball
for a whole hour.

110
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,152
[exhales]

111
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,598
Done.

112
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,518
Curtis. Is it time?

113
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,274
Not yet, Tanya. Soon.

114
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,836
[horn blasting]

115
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,949
[Edgar] Red letter?

116
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,237
Yeah, it's the one
we've been waiting for.

117
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,868
Our informant gave us a name.

118
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,519
N-A-M...

119
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,558
[Curtis] Nam Kung Min Soo.

120
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,871
He's a security expert.
He's in the prison section now.

121
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,598
Wait, you're joking right?

122
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,597
- He's in prison?
- Hey, out of here.

123
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,074
No, I'm just saying,
what kind of chance do we have?

124
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,470
- Edgar.
- I just think if this guy

125
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,910
says that he's such
a great security expert,

126
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,834
- why can't he just break himself...
- That's enough. Go.

127
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,913
Let's go, Tim.
Come on, let's go.

128
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,234
Edgar just wants to help, you know.

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,752
Thinks the world of you.

130
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,949
He shouldn't worship me
the way he does.

131
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,832
I'm not who he thinks I am.

132
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,510
Few of us ever are.

133
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,112
All right, we're here.

134
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,556
Tail section, quarantine
section, prison section.

135
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,116
Gate, gate, gate.

136
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,748
Four seconds when all three
gates are open at once.

137
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,630
We have four seconds to go through
three gates and bust Nam out.

138
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,792
Then Nam gets us the rest of the way.

139
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,434
Our fate depends on this man.

140
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,393
Yeah.

141
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,757
If we can get him to cooperate,
he can take us

142
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,672
all the way to the front of the train.

143
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,078
Very front section?

144
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,199
Yeah.

145
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,671
From here right
to the front of the train.

146
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,472
Everything in one stroke.

147
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,989
We control the engine,
we control the world.

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,991
Without that, we have nothing.

149
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,388
All past revolutions have failed
because they couldn't take the engine.

150
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,556
What are you saying?

151
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,958
This time we take the engine.

152
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,239
Then what?

153
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,114
- We kill them.
- Wilford?

154
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,275
You should run the train now,
not Wilford.

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,833
I am a shadow
of my former shadow.

156
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,989
My day was decades ago.

157
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,432
[Edgar] How old is Gilliam?

158
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,431
Shut up, Edgar.

159
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,270
I'm not saying
that I want that to happen.

160
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,953
That's not what I'm saying.

161
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,515
What I mean is he will die someday.

162
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,549
And when that happens,
you're gonna have to take over.

163
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,113
You're gonna have to run the train.

164
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,632
I'm not a leader.

165
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,508
I don't know.

166
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,400
I think you'd be pretty good
if you ask me.

167
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,750
-Hey, Edgar
-Hmm?

168
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,875
How far back can you remember?

169
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,155
I don't know, like what?

170
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,232
Your mother, you remember her?

171
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,672
I can remember her face...

172
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,639
...every once in a while.

173
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,788
But it's not clear.

174
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,516
- [door clatters]
- [man] Stay down, everybody.

175
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,478
- Everybody stay in your place.
- [man 2] Fucking look at me.

176
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,351
[man] Keep down, keep down.
Easy.

177
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,193
- Medical inspection.
- All the kids come with me.

178
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,349
Just the kids.

179
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,351
- Just a medical check up.
- [man 3] Medical inspection.

180
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,830
- You're doing good.
- Everybody, all the kids.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,709
- [woman] All the kids? Again?
- That's right, just come.

182
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,678
Stay back there, ma'am.
Just stay back there.

183
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,991
Hello, what's this?
One more. Yup, come on.

184
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,754
- You need to go.
- We don't need to do that.

185
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,309
- There's nothing wrong with him.
- It's just a medical check.

186
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,596
You just stay back there.

187
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,718
Come on, that's right.
Come join the others, OK.

188
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,034
[man] You, go and check.

189
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,316
- [man 2] Don't move.
- Go, Timmy! Go!

190
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,630
- Run!
- No!

191
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,030
[all shouting]

192
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,197
Timmy!

193
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,755
[commotion continues]

194
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,792
- That's her baby!
- Please!

195
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,474
Andy! Andy!

196
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,554
Give me back my son!

197
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,711
Give me my son, you fucking bitch!

198
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,235
Andy! Andy!

199
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,435
[man] Why did you let him
throw his shoe?!

200
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,034
[shouting continues]

201
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,517
- [Curtis] Timmy! Timmy!
- Timmy!

202
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,279
At this altitude,
we need only seven minutes.

203
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,034
[clock ticking]

204
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,116
[wind howling]

205
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,233
[screaming]

206
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,992
[hissing, thud]

207
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,077
[screaming stops]

208
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,869
Seven minutes allotted
for your speech, sir.

209
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,230
[translating in different
foreign languages]

210
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,830
No, no, we don't need all that,
I've only got seven minutes.

211
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,917
[metal clattering]

212
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,912
Passengers.

213
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,271
This is not a shoe.

214
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,428
This is disorder.

215
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,277
This is size-ten chaos.

216
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,919
This, see this? This is death.

217
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,119
In this locomotive we call home,
there is one thing that,

218
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,635
between our warm hearts
and the bitter cold...

219
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,510
- [sobbing]
- Clothing? Jeans? No, order.

220
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,151
Order is the barrier that holds
back the frozen death.

221
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,439
We must all of us,
on this train of life,

222
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,398
remain in our allotted station.

223
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,039
We must each of us,

224
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,268
occupy our preordained
particular position.

225
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,074
Would you wear a shoe
on your head?

226
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,958
Of course you wouldn't wear
a shoe on your head.

227
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,712
A shoe doesn't belong in your head.

228
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,713
A shoe belongs on your foot.

229
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,110
A hat belongs on your head.

230
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,033
I am a hat, you are a shoe.

231
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,272
I belong on the head,
you belong on the foot.

232
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,233
Yes? So it is.

233
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,796
In the beginning, order was
prescribed by your ticket.

234
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,669
First class, economy,
and freeloaders like you.

235
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,311
Eternal order is prescribed
by the Sacred Engine.

236
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,280
All things flow
from the Sacred Engine.

237
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,431
All things in their place.

238
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,716
All passengers in their section.

239
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,514
All water flowing, all heat rising,

240
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,319
pays homage to the Sacred Engine.

241
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,790
In its own particular

242
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,077
preordained position.

243
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,196
So it is.

244
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,759
Now, as in the beginning,

245
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,992
I belong to the front.

246
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,675
You belong to the tail.

247
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,710
When the foot seeks
the place of the head

248
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,318
a sacred line is crossed.

249
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,914
Know your place.

250
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,236
Keep your place.

251
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,958
Be a shoe.

252
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,878
Well, we have 42 seconds left.

253
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,237
So we can go to comment
of Mr. Wilford,

254
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,915
the divine keeper
of the Sacred Engine.

255
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,308
[beeping]

256
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,431
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

257
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,478
- [radio static]
- Are you there?

258
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,118
Are you there, sir?

259
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,558
[static continues]

260
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,039
Oh, it's breaking up.

261
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,912
Oh, well.

262
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,630
Mr. Wilford's a very busy man.

263
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,753
So it is.

264
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,717
[timer dings]

265
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,395
- Are we just gonna watch?
- Not now.

266
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,477
I'm not just gonna fucking sit here.

267
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,596
[spoon clanking]

268
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,834
[arm shatters]

269
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,679
[screaming]

270
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,313
No, I'm all right.

271
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,078
Stop. Stop right there. Sit down.

272
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,959
Put that useless gun down.
Put it away.

273
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,559
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam.

274
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,676
It's a pleasure!

275
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,989
You look healthy.

276
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,993
He's fine.

277
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,149
Minister Mason, please deliver
a message to Mr. Wilford.

278
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,719
Certainly, what shall I say?

279
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,678
Tell him he and I need to talk.

280
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,957
Well, you can talk to me.

281
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,112
Mr. Wilford has no reason
to visit here.

282
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,398
Not here.

283
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,391
At the front.

284
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,199
[Edgar speaking indistinctly]

285
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,030
Your son will be a hero, I promise.

286
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,156
Or daughter, whatever it is.

287
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,072
I got it. I got it.

288
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,713
Your contribution has
been duly noted. Thanks.

289
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,918
[shouting]

290
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,354
So sorry to interrupt you
while you're praying.

291
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,710
What are you doing, man?
So sorry.

292
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,950
[both speaking foreign language]

293
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,758
There's your Buddha back,
thanks very much.

294
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,876
[man continues
in foreign language]

295
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,875
Move, move, move, move,
move, move, move!

296
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,717
- [man] Stop fooling around.
- Whoo! Oh!

297
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,110
I've got a better batch.

298
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,555
Stronger, fresh, uncut.

299
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,517
Want to try some?

300
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,351
How many protein blocks for
ten rocks of uncut kronole?

301
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,349
[indistinct chattering]

302
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,798
They don't have bullets.

303
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,072
[Gilliam] Why do you say that?

304
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,719
[Curtis] You remember
what Mason said?

305
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,036
She said, "Put down that useless gun."

306
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,035
She meant she wouldn't give
the order to shoot me.

307
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,394
No.

308
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,833
No, I think the guns
are literally useless.

309
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,310
They used up all their bullets
four years ago, in the last revolt.

310
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,558
Bullets are extinct.

311
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,352
If you're wrong, we could be
finished before we even start.

312
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,829
I think we should be patient.

313
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,035
Wait for the next red letter.

314
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,711
[group chants] One, two.
One, two.

315
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,348
[Curtis] To the left and right.

316
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,875
Not yet! Up, up. Now left.

317
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,998
[group continues]
One, two. One, two.

318
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,391
One, two. One, two.

319
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,316
[man shouting orders, indistinct]

320
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,390
Hello? Andrew.

321
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,118
Andrew!

322
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,034
Wake up. Rise and shine.

323
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,875
When you dream too much of the sun,
you forget the trees.

324
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,114
I believe this is your son.

325
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,956
I'm s... I'm sorry, it's not very good.

326
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,111
It's not my best work.
It's a little dark.

327
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,272
But, if you look
very deep into the eyes,

328
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,516
you can see a little bit of hope.

329
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,353
What about my boy?
You got one of Timmy?

330
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,873
Oh, yes, Tanya. I do.

331
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,871
Easy, easy.
Come off this easy.

332
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,473
Don't hurt yourself.

333
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,837
Here. There you go. Timmy.

334
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,515
[wistful chuckle] Look at him.

335
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,471
That little... That little smile.

336
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,152
Curtis, you gotta
let me come with you.

337
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,038
No, Tanya, I'm sorry.

338
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,395
You will be if you
don't let me come.

339
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,352
I'm going to the front and
I'm gonna make that bitch sorry

340
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,120
- she put her hands on my boy.
- Make this one tighter.

341
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,270
You know I'm stronger than all these
skinny-ass soldiers anyway.

342
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,353
Please.

343
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,797
- [alarm blares]
- [Edgar] Shit, what's going on?

344
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,838
Change of schedule, boys.
Move it back. Now or never.

345
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,396
Don't panic.
Stick with the plan.

346
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,628
Hide that, hide your weapons
in your clothes.

347
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,796
- Head check.
- Yeah, yeah.

348
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,478
Line up.

349
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,034
All right, sit down.

350
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,876
One. Two. Three.

351
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,598
What the fuck do we do?

352
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,593
[soldier] Five. Six. Keep going.

353
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,876
I've had enough of this
protein block bullshit.

354
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,439
Yeah, this is bullshit!

355
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,989
- We're fucking hungry!
- [Tanya] I want chicken.

356
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,838
We're not gonna sit down
for this shit.

357
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,476
We want chicken!
Chicken!

358
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,029
[all shouting]

359
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,952
[soldier] Quiet! Be quiet!

360
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,237
Calm down. It's OK.

361
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,550
You want him fucking dead?
Is that it?

362
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,035
Keep quiet.

363
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,952
Still going for it, are we?

364
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,557
Come on, let's go!
Let's do it.

365
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,468
The rifles.

366
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,153
No, we can overwhelm them.

367
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,271
We easily outnumber their bullets.

368
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,079
[Gilliam] This is it.

369
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,313
Curtis, come on.

370
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,710
We're out of time,
we gotta do it now.

371
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,429
They've got no bullets!

372
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,313
[chaotic shouting]

373
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,918
Move! Keep going!
Keep going, keep going!

374
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,680
Close the gate quick! Shut it!

375
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,272
- [grunting]
- [crowd shouting]

376
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,068
[grunting]

377
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,070
[fighters grunt and shout]

378
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,839
[grunting]

379
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,790
I'm fine, Grey. You go now.

380
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,830
[crowd cheering]

381
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,191
[guard screams]

382
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,349
Fuck.

383
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,112
Nam Koong Min Soo.

384
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,635
Kronole addict.
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

385
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,075
- Hurry up, Edgar.
- Hurry up?

386
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,073
So sorry for keeping
you all waiting.

387
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,079
Obviously, I work here so...

388
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,751
[clicks]

389
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,514
- Open it.
- Here we go.

390
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,751
[Edgar] Hey.

391
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,672
Kronole head.

392
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,993
So this is kronole?

393
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,639
I hear it's pretty big
in the front section.

394
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,189
Careful, that's how
these guys hallucinate.

395
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,316
It's industrial waste.

396
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,040
And it's highly flammable.

397
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,231
Are you Nam Koong Min Soo,
security specialist?

398
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,749
Did you design all the door locks
and security systems on the train?

399
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,639
[Edgar] Look at him man, he's gone.
Look at his eyes.

400
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,836
He's fried his brain
with that fucking shite.

401
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,679
Are you Nam?

402
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,593
[sighs]

403
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,433
Nam, are you listening?

404
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,160
[device translates into Korean]

405
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,873
[speaks Korean]

406
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,838
[device translates]
Yes, I'm listening, fuck.

407
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,676
[speaking Korean]

408
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,436
Unknown words found. Please
try again with correct vocabulary.

409
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,958
We need your help.

410
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,439
For what?

411
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,273
We're going to the front.

412
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,670
And we need you
to open up the gates.

413
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,158
What if I say no?

414
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,590
Uncut, straight from the barrel.

415
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,389
Every door you open,
you get one lump of kronole.

416
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,994
Jesus, Marlboro Light?

417
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,918
[man] I can't believe it.

418
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,914
Cigarettes have been extinct
for more than ten years now.

419
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,995
Want one?

420
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,280
I won't waste it on a prick like you.

421
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,312
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

422
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,277
You help us, you get your drug.

423
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,954
If not, we put you back
where we found you.

424
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,355
What'll it be, asshole?

425
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,433
[Edgar] Chan.

426
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,068
Chan, get out of here.
Let's get out. Hey.

427
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,400
[crowd clamoring]

428
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,793
Come here!

429
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,235
Hey, that's enough.

430
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,193
Put him back
in the fucking drawer!

431
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,472
Get up.

432
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,914
[device] My daughter, Yona.

433
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,674
- If I go, she goes, too.
- So you're coming with us?

434
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,791
[speaking Korean]

435
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,395
[device] One gate,
two lumps of kronole.

436
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,120
She's an addict, too?

437
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,231
[belches]

438
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,917
[electricity zapping]

439
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,038
[doors rumbling]

440
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,752
[sighs]

441
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,953
[continues zapping]

442
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,429
[rumbling continues]

443
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,315
Nobody there.

444
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,188
Kronole?

445
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,912
[inhales deeply]

446
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,189
[exhales]

447
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,991
[inhales]

448
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,193
[indistinct chattering]

449
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,557
[Tanya] Look at all these beds.
Where is everybody?

450
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,751
[Edgar] Looks like
they left in a hurry.

451
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,799
[man] There's food on the table.

452
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,432
This can't be a window, can it?

453
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,278
Still cold.

454
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,873
Dead.

455
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,716
All dead.

456
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,076
All right, let's go everyone.

457
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,912
Stay focused.
We didn't come here for this.

458
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,792
You heard the man, let's go.
Come on, move. Move.

459
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,433
Nam! Nam!

460
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,596
Kronole.

461
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,155
How did you know
there was nobody there?

462
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,753
He's running.

463
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,592
Paul?

464
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,998
Paul! What the hell is he doing?

465
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,479
- Paul!
- [Curtis] He looks so different.

466
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,789
Just a second.

467
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,520
It's used to be automatic,
but parts went extinct.

468
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,910
- [grunts]
- It's not the Paul I remember.

469
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,918
No. Paul? It's Curtis!

470
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,793
They ain't coming back,
so now I gotta do it...

471
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,992
[grunting]
Whoo! ...manually.

472
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,196
[machine whirring]

473
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,878
Mmm, still hot.

474
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,238
Look at them all.
You do some nice work.

475
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,799
That's right man,
there's your food.

476
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,359
There's your protein blocks.

477
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,233
Is this why they took you?
To make this garbage?

478
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,233
- [Paul] Huh?
- Paul?

479
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,478
You've been alone
this whole time?

480
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,756
Huh. Alone. Ha-ha!

481
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,388
In the zone.

482
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,872
We're going to the front.
Come with us.

483
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,270
All right, you're going
to the front? Yeah, man!

484
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,069
But no way, man.
My place is here, all right?

485
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,152
Here? Making this crap? Why?

486
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,231
[gasps loudly]

487
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,716
[gasps sharply]

488
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,910
[panting]

489
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,950
[Curtis] You can't draw this.

490
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,319
OK.

491
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,711
[loud rock music plays]

492
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,518
Oh, man.

493
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,750
All this time,
we've been eating this shit?

494
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,309
Hey. I eat them too, you know?

495
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,471
Every single day.

496
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,192
Where'd you get this?

497
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,634
[stammers]

498
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,353
Have you been the one writing these?

499
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,080
Man, I don't write them.
[stammers]

500
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,435
Why do you have this?
Who gave this to you?

501
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,359
They just leave them for me, man.

502
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,351
I put them in the protein blocks.

503
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,916
I send them on. That's it.

504
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,198
The water supply section?

505
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,630
Yeah, it's just a few cars up.

506
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,509
It's where the water's
cleansed and recycled.

507
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,717
It's one of the most crucial
sections in the train.

508
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,231
[Curtis] If we take it,
we have the upper hand?

509
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,153
We don't even have to go
to the very front.

510
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,914
We control the water...

511
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,469
...we control the negotiation.

512
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,518
Uh, hi. Hi. Excuse me,
sorry to bother you there.

513
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,792
Could I get you a glass
of water to speed this up?

514
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,790
Listen, would you get on with it, man?
You're keeping us all fucking waiting!

515
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,152
- [device] Am I?
- [Edgar] Yeah, you are.

516
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,318
Although you have been fucking
smelling that flammable shite,

517
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,598
that time is a probably a distant
fucking concept for you, isn't it?

518
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,715
Of course,
I'm only doing this for kronole.

519
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,509
Here we go again.
Kronole this, kronole that.

520
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,956
Christ almighty man,
do some fucking work.

521
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,111
You're the ones
who keep giving it to me.

522
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,077
Are you a bit thick?
That's what you asked for

523
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,151
each time you opened the gate.

524
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,197
[Nam] So that's what I'm doing.

525
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,874
[voices continue, indistinct]

526
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,958
Yona? It's Yona right?

527
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,517
How old are you?

528
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,152
Seventeen.

529
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,113
Seventeen? You're a train baby then.

530
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,592
How about you?

531
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,276
Seventeen years on earth.

532
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,113
Seventeen years in the tail section.

533
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,510
Earth?

534
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,193
What was it like?

535
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,396
I don't remember.

536
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,709
Why?

537
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,277
I don't want to remember
anything before I met Gilliam.

538
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,199
Yona...

539
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,755
...are you clairvoyant?

540
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,117
Clairvoyant? What's that?

541
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,398
Well, you always seem to know
what's behind the gates.

542
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,312
Do you see things in your mind?

543
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,238
Don't open it.

544
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,072
[Curtis] What?

545
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,035
Lock the gate!

546
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,189
[zaps]

547
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,997
Be careful.

548
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,592
Yeah.

549
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,398

[chaotic shouting]

551
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,908
Team two, move!

552
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,195

[horn blares]

559
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,354

[woman on PA in foreign language]

561
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,158
We're at the bridge, guys!

562
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,396

seven, six, five, four,

564
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,880
three, two, one!

565
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,638
Happy New Year!

566
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,439
I hate getting old,
I fucking hate it.

[shouting in foreign language]

568
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,710
- Everybody down!
- Hang on!

569
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,678
Impact!

570
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,357
Not yet! A second one!

571
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,795
Stay down!

572
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,154
Hey, Nam, what are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

573
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,390
He's high as a fucking kite.

574
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,518
Here it comes.

575
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,548
Safe passage.

576
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,239

578
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,399
- [man] Hey, watch it!
- [shouting stops]

579
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,235
[man] What was that?

580
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,197
[clears throat grotesquely]

581
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,396
One, two. One, two.

582
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,432
Happy Yekaterina bridge,
you filthy ingrates.

583
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,438
You people, who, were it not
for the benevolent Wilford,

584
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,275
would have frozen solid
18 years ago today...

585
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,955
You people, who have suckled
the generous titty of Wilford

586
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,079
ever since, for food and shelter.

587
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,550
And now, in front of

588
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,236
our hallowed water
supply section no less,

589
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,073
you repay his kindness

590
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,350
with violent hooliganism.

591
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,990
You scum.

592
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,276
Precisely 74 percent of you shall die.

593
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,348
My friend, you suffer from
the misplaced optimism of the doomed.

594
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,676
This is going to be good.

595
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,678
Curtis...

00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,911
[Nam speaks Korean]

597
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,559
What? What did he say?

598
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,438
He said you guys are fucked.

600
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,518

[Nam speaking Korean]

602
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,110
There's a tunnel right after
Yekaterina Bridge.

603
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,599
- A tunnel?
- Mm-hm.

604
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,159
A fucking long one.

606
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,710

[chaotic shouting]

612
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,235
[Curtis] Chan, get out, get out.

613
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,031
Chan! We need fire!

614
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,953
[Edgar] Chan, bring the fire!

615
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,588
[indistinct shouting]

What are you doing?
Don't look at me, you dozy boger!

[crowd roaring]

624
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,270
Put me down,

seen these kids? Hmm?

- [screams]
- [ax clangs on metal]

651
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,275
Where are they, you bitch?

652
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,591
I don't know, I don't know.
It's not me.

653
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,478
It's not me. [whimpering]

654

Tell us or we'll cut your
fucking arm off

you bastard.

Wilford...
Wilford likes kids.

658
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,311
He does.

659
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,234
That's why he sends that yellow one,
Claude, to get them for him.

660
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,072
It's Wilford you want, not me!

661
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,835
[Gilliam] Wilford likes kids?

662
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,275
All he cares about
is his wretched engine.

663
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,596
The engine is sacred.

664
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,149
And Wilford is divine.

665
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,352
Wilford is merciful.

666
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,479
Call him.

667
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,029
See if he'll come save you.

668
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,390
[Gilliam] Yes.

669
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,994
Wilford the merciful.

670
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,639
Call him.

671
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,634
He won't come here,
he won't leave his engine.

672
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,473
We're gonna rip you
into little pieces.

673
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,914
He still won't come?

674
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,875
Well, we control the water.

675
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,439
We turn that off,
he'll have to come.

676
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,870
Turn off the water?

677
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,953
You'll only be condemning
your own people.

678
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,429
The water comes from the front.

679
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,672
The nose of the train,
it breaks up the snow and ice

680
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,958
and turns it into water,
like an elephant's trunk.

681
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,477
The water comes in the mouth.
Not in the bum, Curtis.

682
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,632
Yes, Wilford knows you well,
Mr. Curtis Everett.

683
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,158
He's been watching you.

684
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,118
And we know you won't harm
your own people.

685
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,270
Too bad you couldn't save
your second in command.

686
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,158
What was his name? Edgar?

687
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,720
- Shut the fuck up!
- Curtis! Curtis, I can help you!

688
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,791
You can fucking die,
is what you can do.

689
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,269
No, I can help you. I swear it.

690
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,674
Listen... Listen to me.

691
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,673
Wilford won't come here.
He's not coming.

692
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,512
You've got to go to him.

693
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,432
And I can take you.

694
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,672
I know the train,
I can guarantee you safe passage.

695
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,990
Why the fuck would I trust you?

696
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,952
Because I want to live.

697
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,553
So you'd sell out
Wilford the Benevolent?

698
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,915
If I take you to the front,
you have to kill him.

699
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,911
I'll get you close enough.

700
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,152
You kill him and let me live.

701
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,989
Curtis?

702
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,272
Are you still determined
to push ahead?

703
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,031
Of course.

704
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,719
We're not even half way.

705
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,839
You already got further
than anyone else.

706
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,512
Better than MacGregor,
four years ago.

707
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,474
Ten cars, 20 cars, it doesn't matter
unless you make it to the engine.

708
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,675
They'll just regroup
and attack us again.

709
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,398
We gotta pull them out by the roots.

710
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,956
So many have been killed.

711
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,677
We've lost so many.

712
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,956
I know.

713
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,917
Seen our men?

714
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,991
They're exhausted.

715
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,515
I told them to wash themselves...

716
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,593
...so that I can assess the damage.

717
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,359
Let me go ahead.

718
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,073
I got Mason now,
I can move a lot faster.

719
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,477
You stay here with the wounded
and guard the prisoners.

720
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,518
Let me take the engine,
I'll call for you to lead us.

721
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,390
Stop it, Curtis.

722
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,596
Why are you doing that?

723
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,314
You know very well that you're
already our leader.

724
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,400
You have to accept that now.

725
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,839
How can I lead if I have two good arms.

726
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,272
It's faded a lot.

727
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,400
Better to have both arms.

728
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,552
You can't do a lot with one,
you know?

729
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,031
Especially when you hold a woman.

730
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,714
Much better to have two arms,
wouldn't you agree?

731
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,397
When you get to the narrow bridge,

732
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,835
big gate with a "W" on it...

733
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,556
...Wilford's behind that.

734
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,269
Don't let Wilford talk.

735
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,395
Cut out his tongue.

736
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,879
[man] OK, let's all get in there.
Squeeze in.

737
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,273
- [laughing]
- [man] Perfect, perfect.

738
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,795
The hat becomes you well.

739
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,076
Now, Grey...

740
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,309
...you must go with Curtis.

741
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,389
[man] Oops, forgot somebody.

742
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,551
OK.

743
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,872
Kronole.

[harpsichord plays gentle music]

746
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,869
Don't mind me, back to work, everyone.
Back to work.

747
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,799
- Minister, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

748
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,276
- Please don't eat it. Don't eat it.
- No, no. They're very friendly.

749
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,671
They won't bite.
Well, they might bite a tomato, but...

750
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,399
Can I eat this?

751
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,950
Train baby like you wouldn't know.

752
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,031
I grew up walking on this every day.

753
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,919
This is what's under all the snow.

754
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,274
Earth!

755
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,436
What's this?

756
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,637
It's moving. Lives under the...

757
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,639
What's that?

758
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,718
Hey.

759
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,629
Do any of you feel like sushi?

760
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,553
Hell, yeah.
Line that shit up.

761
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,119
Right? [chuckles]

762
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,798
[Mason] You people are very lucky.

763
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,191
This is only served twice in a year.

764
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,794
In January and July.

765
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,996
Why? Not enough fish?

766
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,634
Oh, enough is not the criterion.

767
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,394
Balance. You see,

768
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,518
this aquarium is a closed
ecological system.

769
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,150
And the number of individual units

770
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,835
must be very closely,
precisely controlled

771
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,709
in order to maintain the proper
sustainable balance.

772
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,677
No, you eat this.

773
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,513
You know what that's made of?

774
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,632
Dig in.

775
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,311
Curtis, my friend,
do you think that we might

776
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,392
dispense with the restraints
for this next section?

777
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,194
I'm not your friend.
And why would I?

778
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,669
Uh, for the...
for the sake of the young?

779
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,034
Education?

780
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,510
[excited squealing and shouting]

781
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,555
- Quiet!
- Good morning, children.

782
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,395
I'm pleased to present guests
from tail section.

783
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,757
[woman] Yes, what do we say
to tail section guests, children?

784
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,629
[kids] Good morning,
tail section guests!

785
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,233
Timmy!

786
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,753
[Andrew] Andy?

787
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,032
- Timmy...?
- Andy? Andy?

788
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,678
This little boy,
his name is Timmy.

789
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,037
This is my son.
Please, take a good look at the picture.

790
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,519
- I saw them.
- When?

791
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,557
- Where?
- Came through there,

792
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,517
went through there.

793
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,750
Is that all, boy?

794
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,353
Yes.

795
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,749
Were they crying?

796
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,514
No, but they looked like they wanted to.

797
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,592
I heard old tail sectioners

798
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,752
were lazy dogs who slept
all day in their own shit.

799
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,718
No, they're very nice!

800
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,998
And very just and merciful.
So it is.

801
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,550
Minister Mason, we were
just about to show a video.

802
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,995
- Very good.

[children] Wilford!

805
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,637
[man narrates] From a very young age,
Mr. Wilford's love

806
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,438
of locomotives was apparent.

807
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,474
When I grow up,
I'll live on a train forever.

808
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,358
[children] Forever!

809
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,590
His early dreams were realized
when he founded

810
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:02,470
his transportation empire,
the Wilford Industries.

811
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,676
But his greatest dream was to construct

812
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,910
a luxury locomotive cruise line,

813
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,999
connecting railways
of the entire world into one.

814
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,995
[man] A circular railway that extends
for 438,000 kilometers,

815
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,469
and completes
one circle every year.

816
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,471
Impervious to the extreme cold
of the Arctic,

and the scorching
heat of the African desert,

As hard as it is to believe,

822
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,272
people in the old world
made fun of Mr. Wilford.

823
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,835
They criticized him
for over-engineering

824
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,958
and over-equipping this wonderful train.

825
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,588
But Mr. Wilford knew
something they did not.

826
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,159
And what was that?

827
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,550
Old world people are frigging morons

[teacher] Well, sort of.

830
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,356
Mr. Wilford knew that CW7
would freeze the world.

831
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,557
So what did the prophetic
Mr. Wilford invent

832
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,393
to protect the chosen
from that calamity?

will surely be on the exam.

Fifteen years ago,
in the third year of the train,

854
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,118
seven passengers tried to stop
Wilford's miracle train

855
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,958
and go outside.

Very good.
Long before you were born.

859

Of course they failed
to stop the train.

860
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,548
Instead they jumped out
of the running train.

888
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,158
No, thank you very much.

889
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,513
Let's go, Curtis.

890
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,319
Happy new year.

891
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,197
Oh! I thought the chicken
was extinct.

892
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,798
There are actually many things on
board that were rumored to be extinct.

893
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,632
Such as?

894
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,235
This.

895
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,918
[all screaming]

896
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,757
Andrew! No!

897
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,153
[gasps]

898
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,516
[gunshot]

899
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,994
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

900
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,151
[horn blows on TV]

901
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,919
[Curtis] No.

902
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,750
- [gun fires]
- [Tanya screams]

903
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,113
[Tanya, faint] Curtis.

904
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,599
[louder, more clear] Curtis!

905
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,838
You have to lead us.

906
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,799
Curtis, my friend,
we understand each other.

907
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,599
Listen to my words, it wasn't me!

908
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,553
[empty clip clatters on the floor]

909
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,119
[loads new clip]

910
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,309
[exhales] We go forward.

911
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,511
[Nam] Now!

912
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,669
Open!

913
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,159
[Nam] Now!

914
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,958
[door hissing open]

915
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,919
- It's Mason.
- Shit, check her pulse.

916
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,474
- [gunfire]
- [people screaming]

917
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,114
Hey, hey! Fire regulation
to minimize dam...

918
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,999
[empty chamber clicks]

919
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,469
[empty chamber clicking]

920
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,277
God, that did not look good.

921
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,519
He's coming.

922
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,671
[indistinct chattering]

923
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,478
[screams]

924
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,548
Hurry, hurry. He's got
a master key, right?

925
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,511
Wait, don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

926
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,675
You just killed a front
section passenger! I'm report...

927
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,520
I didn't see a thing.

928
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,750
Where are you going?
Just wait a minute!

929
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,150
Could we talk about it
just for one second?

930
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,394
[groans]

931
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,192
You son of a bitch!

932
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,838
[screams]

933
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,555
[bones breaking]

934
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,876
[whimpers]

935
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,477
Close the door, jerk.

936
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,712
[all shouting]

937
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,472
[Nam groaning]

938
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,910
[both grunting]

939
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,669
[screams]

940
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,750
[panting]

941
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,758
Tanya.

942
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,032
My Timmy.

943
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,154
My Timmy.

944
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,278
[muttering]

945
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,159
[sobs]

946
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,033
We're gonna find him.

947
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,958
I promise.

948
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,751
I know.

949
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,479
Thank you.

950
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,030
[electronic dance music playing]

951
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,794
[sniffs] You grab some, too.

952
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,957
[woman shrieking]

953
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,233
[man] Hey, I want my kronole!

954
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,676
Hey, turn around, motherfucker.
You got my kronole.

955
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,230
- I want that shit.
- [woman] Hey, asshole, give it back!

956
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,994
[angry shouting]

957
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,116
[man] What the fuck
you think you're doing?

958
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:17,158
[muffled shouting]

959
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,395
[machines churning loudly]

960
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,116
[intoxicated Yona laughing]

961
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,919
[Yona singing, unintelligible]

962
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,719
[continues laughing]

963
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,191
[Yona moaning]

964
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,193
Open the door.

965
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,873
Huh?

966
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,676
Kronole first. Kronole.

967
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,671
Kronole? You want kronole?

968
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,558
- Here. Take it.
- [grunting]

969
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,030
Open it!
Open the gate!

970
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,955
You're crazy!

971
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,790
[both men grunting]

972
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,871
[moaning]

973
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,716
What the hell's wrong with you?
You and your fucking gates.

974
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,351
Here, have a smoke.

975
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,435
[device beeps]

976
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,431
[speaking Korean]

977
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,272
[device] You should be grateful.

978
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,513
That's the world's last cigarette,
you tail section pig.

979
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,513
You ever been to the tail section?

980
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,194
[device translating]

981
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,112
Do you have any idea
what went on back there?

982
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,192
When we boarded?

983
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,471
It was chaos.

984
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:59,678
Yeah, we didn't freeze to death,
but we didn't have time to be thankful.

985
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,753
Wilford's soldiers came
and they took everything.

986
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,195
It was a thousand people
in an iron box.

987
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,436
No food, no water.

988
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,509
After a month, we ate the weak.

989
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,037
[crying softly]

990
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,869
You know what I hate about myself?

991
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,240
I know what people taste like.

992
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,434
I know that babies taste best.

993
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,836
There was a woman.

994
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,155
She was hiding with her baby.

995
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,318
Then some men with knives came.

996
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,032
They killed her
and they took her baby.

997
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,831
And then an old man...

998
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:31,955
No relation, just an old man,

999
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,475
stepped forward and he said:

1000
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,599
"Give me the knife."

1001
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,714
Everyone thought he'd
kill the baby himself.

1002
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,439
But he took the knife...

1003
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,432
...and he cut off his arm.

1004
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,636
And he said,
"Eat this if you're so hungry.

1005
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,277
Eat this, just leave the baby."

1006
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,634
I had never seen anything like that.

1007
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,268
And the men put down their knives.

1008
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,513
Probably guessed who that old man was.

1009
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,270
That baby was Edgar.

1010
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,634
And I was the man with the knife.

1011
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,150
I killed Edgar's mother.

1012
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,150
And then one by one,
other people in the tail section

1013
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:05,279
started cutting off arms and legs
and offering them.

1014
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:10,074
It was like a miracle.

1015
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,078
And I wanted to.

1016
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,593
I tried.

1017
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,559
A month later, Wilford's soldiers
brought those protein blocks.

1018
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,280
We've been eating that shit ever since.

1019
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,274
Eighteen years I've hated Wilford.

1020
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,071
Eighteen years I've waited
for this moment.

1021
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,512
And now I'm here.

1022
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,716
Open the gate.

1023
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,472
Please.

1024
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,509
Thanks for your story, Curtis.

1025
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,110
But I don't want to open the gate.

1026
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,357
I want to open the gate...

1027
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,638
...but not this gate.

1028
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,759
That one.

1029
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,230
The gate to the outside world.

1030
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,151
It's been frozen shut for 18 years.

1031
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,158
You might take it as a wall.

1032
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,159
But it's a fucking gate.

1033
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,951
Let's open it and just get the hell out.

1034
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,874
And freeze to death?
What are you, fucking crazy?

1035
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,835
What if we don't?

1036
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,308
What if we could survive outside?

1037
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,837
Remember the Yekaterina Bridge?

1038
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,514
When your guys were getting chopped up?

1039
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:40,353
There's something
I look at every New Year.

1040
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:44,513
A crashed airplane under the snow.

1041
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:53,639
All I saw ten years ago
was just the tail.

1042
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:58,510
Now the body and wings are peeking out.

1043
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,037
Less ice and snow means...

1044
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,397
...it's melting.

1045
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,793
The type of snow that's about to melt.

1046
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,155
A little push and it all falls down.

1047
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,877
And you know what I saw recently?

1048
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,990
Outside the window, there was...

1049
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,317
[laughing]

1050
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,832
Never mind...

1051
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,996
No need to tell you this.

1052
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,390
You gotta take it easy
on that kronole.

1053
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,233
Snorting that flammable shit's
gonna fry your brain.

1054
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,550
That's exactly right.

1055
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,638
Think of what kronole is.

1056
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,953
This fucking flammable
industrial waste...

1057
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,917
Light it up, and boom.

1058
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:59,710
It's a bomb you idiot.

1059
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,276
I didn't stock this shit
for years just to get high.

1060
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,193
It's to blow up this gate.

1061
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,191
Give me the matches.

1062
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,476
What the fuck are you doing?

1063
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,200
- Give it to me.
- Take that off the door.

1064
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,999
[grunts] Fire!

1065
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,472
[gun fires]

1066
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,155
Curtis Everett.

1067
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,118
I've been asked to extend
a formal invitation

1068
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,750
from Mr. Wilford
to join him for dinner.

1069
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,309
After you.

1070
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,394
Curtis? Is that you?

1071
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,597
Curtis, dear boy.

1072
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,432
Come in.

1073
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,436
Let's take a look at you.

1074
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,033
You hungry?

1075
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:33,312
You did a man's work,
coming all this way.

1076
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,431
Please, sit down.

1077
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,511
You are the first human being

1078
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:44,037
to have walked the total length
of this train, tail to engine.

1079
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,758
Did you know that?

1080
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,235
Well done. Bravo.

1081
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:53,394
None of your people have ever
been here, to the engine.

1082
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,313
I've never been to the tail section.

1083
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,313
Why not? Too dirty for you?

1084
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,869
Don't want to rub against
the vermin of the tail section?

1085
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:05,749
Do you think my station is
without its own drawbacks?

1086
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,478
It's noisy.

1087
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,835
And it's lonely.

1088
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,832
Right.

1089
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,276
Steaks. Plenty of room.

1090
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,351
This whore to bring you
anything you want.

1091
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,069
Curtis, everyone has their
preordained position.

1092
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,629
And everyone is in their place
except you.

1093
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,639
That's what people in the best place say
to the people in the worst place.

1094
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,833
There's not a soul on this train
who wouldn't trade places with you.

1095
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,958
- Would you trade places with me?
- Fuck you.

1096
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,672
Curtis, dear boy,

1097
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:44,799
the fact is, we are all stuck
inside this blasted train.

1098
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,997
We are all prisoners
in this hunk of metal.

1099
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,718
Medium rare?

1100
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,314
And this train is
a closed ecosystem.

1101
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,914
We must always strive for balance.

1102
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:58,117
Air, water, food supply...

1103
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,953
Population must always
be kept in balance.

1104
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:05,233
For optimum balance, however,
there have been times when more

1105
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,277
radical solutions were required,

1106
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,716
when the population needed
to be reduced, rather...

1107
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,068
...drastically.

1108
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,515
[all screaming]

1109
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,512
We don't have time
for true natural selection.

1110
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:24,430
We would all be hideously over-crowded
and starved, waiting for that.

1111
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,117
The next best solution

1112
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:32,751
is to have individual units
kill off other individual units.

1113
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:36,469
From time to time, we've
had to stir the pot, so to speak.

1114
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,835
The Revolt of the Seven,

1115
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,353
the MacGregor Riots,

1116
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,796
the Great Curtis Revolution.

1117
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:47,999
A blockbuster production
with a devilishly unpredictable plot.

1118
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,878
Who could have predicted
your counter attack

1119
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,678
with the torch
in the Yekaterina Tunnel?

1120
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,956
Pure genius.

1121
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,236
That wasn't what Gilliam
and I had in our plan.

1122
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,197
What?

1123
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,631
Don't tell me you didn't know.

1124
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,439
Gilliam and I... our plan.

1125
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,269
Gilliam?

1126
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,311
Gilliam.

1127
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,715
The front and the tail are
supposed to work together.

1128
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:17,873
He was more than a partner, really.

1129
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:20,634
- He was my friend.
- Bullshit.

1130
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,392
I don't believe you.

1131
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,396
Our original agreement
was for the insurgency

1132
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,471
to end at the Yekaterina Tunnel.

1133
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,313
And all the survivors would go
back to the tail section

1134
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:35,268
- to enjoy much more space.
- You're a fucking liar.

1135
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,919
Gilliam would never do that.

1136
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,753
It all worked out in the end.

1137
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,913
Your counter attack actually made
the insurgency ten times more exciting.

1138
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,629
Unfortunately, the front suffered
more losses than anticipated

1139
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:52,078
and Gilliam had to...
[clicks tongue] ...pay the price.

1140
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,515
Ironic, isn't it?

1141
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:02,277
How people dramatically cross that
thin barrier between life and death.

1142
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:05,238
Now there's just
one last thing for us to do.

1143
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,239
Tally up the numbers.

1144
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,516
[telephone ringing]

1145
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,909
Hello Wilford, it's me.

1146
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,718
I'm at Gilliam's place.

1147
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,598
Hold on.

1148
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,796
Is it still the same number?

1149
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,679
Yes, it still stands at 74 percent.

1150
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,671
OK, carry on.

1151
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,512
Oh, wait.

1152
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:39,036
Spare 18, to celebrate our 18th year.

1153
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,112
It's an excellent idea.

1154
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,878
Yes.

1155
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,394
- [gunfire]
- [people screaming]

1156
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:51,834
Your people.

1157
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:56,028
Goddamn it, Claude!
Mind the Engine!

1158
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,474
She's getting sensitive recently.

1159
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,798
Sit down and
mind your table manners.

1160
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,512
Just relax.

1161
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,153
Calm down.

1162
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,276
Boy, now I can see what Gilliam meant.

1163
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,995
He told me you were brilliant
and clever, but always so tense.

1164
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,034
When's the last time
you got laid? Hmm?

1165
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,796
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman
is much better with two arms.

1166
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,354
[panting]

1167
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,876
I'll miss Gilliam. [soft chuckle]

1168
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,474
I'll miss our
late night phone chats.

1169
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:47,428
Oh, he could go on for hours.

1170
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,598
All with only one arm.

1171
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,513
What's with that face?

1172
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,630
Hmm? What's the matter?

1173
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,360
You look like a crazy person.

1174
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,715
As if there aren't enough
crazies on this train.

1175
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,314
[clattering]

1176
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,917
[gasps] Blood!

1177
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,750
Are you OK?

1178
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,239
[groaning]

1179
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,237
What happened?

1180
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,109
Get down!

1181
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,799
[Yona screaming]

1182
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,030
[both grunting]

1183
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,953
- [screams]
- [bones snapping]

1184
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,673
- [weapons clanking]
- [angry chatter]

1185
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,430
[coughing] Yona!

1186
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,398
We need to open that
gate and get the kronole!

1187
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,553
See the wires inside?

1188
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,352
A shit load!

1189
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:14,428
Kill you, punk!

1190
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:19,109
I believe it is easier for
someone to survive on this train

1191
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,078
if they have some level of insanity.

1192
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,035
I mean, as Gilliam well understood,

1193
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:30,079
we need to maintain a proper
balance of anxiety and fear,

1194
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:33,875
chaos and horror,
in order to keep life going.

1195
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,072
And if we don't have that,

1196
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,470
we need to invent it.

1197
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:42,916
In that sense, the Great Curtis
Revolution you invented

1198
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,389
was truly a masterpiece.

1199
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,358
Yona! Red goes into eight!

1200
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:49,873
No, seven, seven!

1201
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:57,911
Come with me, Curtis.

1202
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,435
Something I want to show you.

1203
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,636
You deserve it.

1204
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,033
Come on.

1205
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,791
She's waking up now.

1206
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:20,076
[engine humming]

1207
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,673
[Wilford] Cozy, yes?

1208
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,671
Peaceful.

1209
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,718
You are now in her heart.

1210
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:56,632
I've devoted my entire life to this.

1211
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,559
The Eternal Engine.

1212
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,834
It is eternity itself.

1213
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,759
Have you ever been
alone on this train?

1214
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,913
When was the last time
you were alone?

1215
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,833
You can't remember, can you?

1216
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:23,959
So please do take your time.

1217
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,789
[panting]

1218
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,795
[sobbing]

1219
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,075
I just wrote it.

1220
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:28,356
It's for you, Curtis.

1221
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,238
Here.

1222
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,271
I am old.

1223
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:48,711
I want you to take my station.

1224
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,552
It's what you always wanted.

1225
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:58,677
It's what Gilliam wanted, too.

1226
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:04,433
You must tend the engine,
keep her humming.

1227
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,199
Look, Curtis...

1228
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,317
...beyond the gate.

1229
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:20,116
Section after section,
precisely where they've always been

1230
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:23,716
and where they'll always be,
all adding up to what?

1231
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,677
The train.

1232
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,478
And now, the perfectly correct
number of human beings,

1233
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,349
all in their proper places,
all adding up to what?

1234
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,397
Humanity.

1235
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,630
The train is the world.

1236
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,519
We, the humanity.

1237
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,638
And now you have the sacred
responsibility to lead all of humanity.

1238
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:54,749
Without you, Curtis,
humanity will cease to exist.

1239
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,270
You've seen what people do
without leadership.

1240
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,079
They devour one another.

1241
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,276
[angry shouting]

1242
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,231
[gate rumbling]

1243
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:13,634
[screams]

1244
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,279
[glass shatters]

1245
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,032
Yona, the kronole!

1246
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,430
- Yona, stop!
- No.

1247
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,874
[gun clicking]

1248
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:35,075
No bullets?

1249
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,191
Put the kronole on the gate!

1250
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,356
Look at them.

1251
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,319
That's how people are.

1252
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,873
You know.

1253
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,758
You've seen this.

1254
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,669
You've been this.

1255
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,709
Ridiculous.
Pathetic, aren't they?

1256
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,714
You can save them from themselves.

1257
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,998
This is what Gilliam saved you for.

1258
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:17,958
Curtis...

1259
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:20,554
...this is your destiny.

1260
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,758
- It's ready!
- Curtis has the matches!

1261
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,873
Curtis! The match!

1262
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:12,278
The space only allows
for a very small person.

1263
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,715
Young children under 5.

1264
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,873
The engine lasts forever,
but not so all of its parts.

1265
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:25,636
That piece of equipment
went extinct recently.

1266
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,189
We needed a replacement.

1267
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,590
Thank goodness the tail section

1268
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,354
manufactures
a steady supply of kids.

1269
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,397
So we can keep going manually.

1270
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,397
[grunting]

1271
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:42,199
You fucking bastard!

1272
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,629
[Curtis shouts in pain]

1273
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:02,155
[motor powers down]

1274
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:06,958
Yona...

1275
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,599
Take the fire.

1276
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,272
[both shouting]

1277
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,753
It's the last one!

1278
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:35,031
[motor begins to hum]

1279
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:37,509
[motor struggles to resume]

1280
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,312
Come on.

1281
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:49,950
[automated voice]
Please stand at a safe distance.

1282
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,635
[voice continues, indistinct]

1283
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:59,039
Please stand at safe distance.

1284
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,679
Andy? Is that you?

1285
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,959
[grunts] Andy!

1286
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:10,588
Do you remember me?

1287
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,473
Andy, stop, listen to me.

1288
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:15,796
Don't go up those stairs. Listen!

1289
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,314
Andy!

1290
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,756
Come here, come over here.

1291
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,152
Andy, listen to me!

1292
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,510
Get out of there!

1293
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,352
[engine humming]

1294
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,395
[Curtis groans]
Goddamn it Andy, listen to me!

1295
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:40,509
Oh, Curtis, don't be so melodramatic.

1296
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:44,389
You know everyone has their own
preordained position.

1297
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,719
[dramatic music builds]

1298
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,514
- [bones snapping]
- [screams]

1299
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,070
[electric zapping]

1300
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,992
[grunting]

1301
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,752
[panting]

1302
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,510
- Nice.
- [panting] Huh?

1303
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:31,398
[faint rumbling]

1304
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,110
[snow cracking]

1305
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:44,797
[faint rumbling continues]

1306
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:10,479
[all screaming]

1307
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:19,391
[faint rumbling]

1308
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:22,358
[fire roaring]

1309
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,350
[panting]

1310
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,988
[Yona] Dad! Dad!

1311
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:43,276
[Yona sobs]

1312
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,070
Curtis.

1313
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:00,399
Stay here.

1314
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,994
[breathing heavily]
